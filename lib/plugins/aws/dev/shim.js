 * the parsed content. If an error is detected, it constructs an Error instance with details from the received message and rejects the promise.
 * If a successful response is received, it resolves with the response data. The second promise serves as a fallback, resolving with a
 * predefined message after a 30-second wait, indicating a timeout occurred. `Promise.race` is used to ensure that the function resolves or
 * rejects based on whichever promise settles first, effectively implementing a timeout mechanism for the operation.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<string|Object>} A promise that either resolves with the successful response from the device or a timeout message,
 * or rejects with an Error instance if the device reports an error. The promise resolves with a string message if the operation times out.
