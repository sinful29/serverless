# Reference YAML/JSON Files

You can reference properties in other YAML or JSON files. To reference properties in other YAML files use the `${file(./myFile.yml):someProperty}` syntax in your `serverless.yml` configuration file.

To reference properties in other JSON files use the `${file(./myFile.json):someProperty}` syntax. It is important that the file you are referencing has the correct suffix, or file extension, for its file type (`.yml` for YAML or `.json` for JSON) in order for it to be interpreted correctly.

Here's an example:

```yml
# myCustomFile.yml
globalSchedule: rate(10 minutes)
```

```yml
# serverless.yml
service: new-service
provider: aws
custom: ${file(./myCustomFile.yml)} # You can reference the entire file
functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - schedule: ${file(./myCustomFile.yml):globalSchedule} # Or you can reference a specific property
  world:
    handler: handler.world
    events:
      - schedule: ${self:custom.globalSchedule} # This would also work in this case
```

In the above example, you're referencing the entire `myCustomFile.yml` file in the `custom` property. You need to pass the path relative to your service directory. You can also request specific properties in that file as shown in the `schedule` property. It's completely recursive and you can go as deep as you want. Additionally you can request properties that contain arrays from either YAML or JSON reference files. Here's a YAML example for an events array:

```yml
myevents:
  - schedule:
      rate: rate(1 minute)
```

and for JSON:

```json
{
  "myevents": [
    {
      "schedule": {
        "rate": "rate(1 minute)"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In your `serverless.yml`, depending on the type of your source file, either have the following syntax for YAML:

```yml
functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events: ${file(./myCustomFile.yml):myevents}
```

or for a JSON reference file use this syntax:

```yml
functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events: ${file(./myCustomFile.json):myevents}
```

**Note:** If the referenced file is a symlink, the targeted file will be read.
